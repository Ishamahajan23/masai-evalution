// ### Question 1: Undo/Redo Text Editor

// **Topic Focus:** State history management
// **Scenario:** Build a simple text editor with Undo and Redo buttons. Track history of changes. Disable Undo when at oldest state, Redo when at newest. Show "History: X/Y" indicating current position. Typing after undo should clear redo history.
// **Hidden Test:** Managing state arrays as stacks, understanding state snapshots
